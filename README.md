## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Initially,I found it very difficult to adjust the lilac background for the desktop design but managed to do so by using a div container and setting the required dimensions to match the design.The following code snippets will give you an idea:

```html
<div id="random"></div>
```
```css
#random{
    position: absolute;
    top: 860px;
    height: 570px;
    width: 770px;
    background-color: hsl(240 75% 98%);
}
```
